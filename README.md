# BIRDWELL
## Live link - [birdwell](https://birdwell.herokuapp.com/#/)

Welcome to birdwell and the production repo for the site. This site is an app clone to [allbirds](https://www.allbirds.com/) ecommerce site. This site specifically was chosen to connect relevant ecommerce backend logic and data structure with a beatiful, yet functional, front end delivery. Given that several key features and functionalities were pursued in creating birdwell, so it is important to note that the site is not an identical clone.

### Technology Used
* Backend Structure
    * birdwell's backend was built from a Rails framework and utilizes Ruby, jbuilder and jquery to communicate with our frontend
* Frontend Structure
    * The frontend is a React framework utilizing the React library heavily relying on Javascript for functionality and CSS to bring the site to life


## Notable Features
* Cart functionality
    * A key feature I want to highlight here is the cart's relevant functionality to an ecommerce site. User's on birdwell can cart product while logged in or logged out. If a user has carted product and then logs in, the carted item will persist and be added to the cart that is associated with their account. A simple effect in the larger UI of a site, but highly relevant for site conversion and a seamless experience.
    * The integral piece in achieving this functionality came from reducer logic and manipulating state in tandem with database queries. 
    * // add code refence
* Product List / Product Detail pages
    * birdwell's product implementation and functionality was achieved by leaning into React libraries and the power that this technology offers. Utilizing succinct React components allowed for a modular approach to the product list and product detial pages done so with a high level of detail that was achieved in a short period of time.
